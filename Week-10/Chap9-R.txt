Statistics and Regression Modeling

- Statistics
  - collection, description, analysis, and inference of conclusions from quantitative data
  - draw reliable conclusions about large groups
  - population (N) sample (n) 
    - n>30 normal distribution
    - n<30 t distribution
  - variables
    - independent variables
      - view the impact of dependent variables
    - dependent variables
      - relied on the independent variable
    - categorical variables
      - qualitative variables or attribute variable
      - nominal
        - name, label or categorize 
          - Dichotomous (two categories)
      - ordinal
        - measurement variable that takes values with an order or rank
    - continuous variables
      - unlimited number of values between the lowest and highest points 
      - interval variables 
        - measured along a continuum
      - ratio variables
        - interval variables
        - 0 (zero) indicates that there is none of that variable

- descriptive statistics
  - describes the properties of sample and population data
  - mean, median, mode
  - range, variance, standard deviation
  - distribution
    - probability distribution function
    - skewness (distortion or asymmetry)
    - kurtosis (tails or peak)
  - Statistical Measures
    - Frequency
    - Central Tendency
    - Dispersion or Variation (Spread)
    - Position
    - Confidence interval 
      - 95% 99%
      - Z-score 

- inferential statistics
  - test hypotheses and draw conclusions
  - make generalisations and predictions about a wider sample group
  - important to use random and unbiased sampling methods
  - Hypothesis testing 
    - tests an assumption regarding a population parameter 
    - state the two hypotheses so that only one can be right
      - H0 Null Hypothesis
      - H1 Alternative Hypothesis
    - formulate an analysis plan (how the data will be evaluated)
    - analyze the sample data
    - analyze the results and either reject the null hypothesis or state that the null hypothesis is plausible
    - p-value is less than or equal to alpha, reject the null hypothesis, result is statistically significant
    - p-value is greater than alpha, fail to reject the null hypothesis, result is not statistically significant
  - Type I error
      - REJECT H0 when the null hypothesis is TRUE 
  - Type II error
      - ACCEPT H0 when it is FALSE
  - parametric tests
    - T-Test
      - determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups
    - ANOVA
      - splits an observed aggregate variability found inside a data set into two parts
        - systematic factors
        - random factors
  - non parametric tests 
    - chi-square (Ï‡2)
      - measures how a model compares to actual observed data 

- Regression Model
  - describes the relationship between one or more independent variables
  - Linear Regression  
    - the relationship between inputs and outputs is a straight line
  - Multiple Linear Regression
    - more than one input variables that may affect the target variable
  - Non-Linear Regression
    - a form of regression analysis in which data is fit to a model and then expressed as a mathematical function
    - can show a prediction of population growth over time
  - Correlation coefficient (r)
    - both variables are continuous: Pearson product-moment
    - both variables are nominal
      - Two categories for each variable: Phi
      - Multiple categories for each variable: Kappa
    -  both variables are ordinal: Spearman rank
    - cor()
    - cor.test()
      - method="pearson"
    - gglot() geom_smooth(method="lm") 
    - predict()
    - stat_smooth()

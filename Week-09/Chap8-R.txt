WQD7004 Chapter 8 Revision

Exploratory Data Analysis
- analyze and investigate data sets
- summarize their main characteristics
- employing data visualization
- understanding of data set variables and the relationships 

Data Exploration Techniques
- Summary Statistics
  - Frequency
    - mode, percentile
  - Location 
    - mean, median, trimmed mean
  - Spread
    - variance, standard deviation
    - average absolute deviation
    - median absolute deviation (MAD)

- Visualization
  - conversion of data into a visual or tabular format
  - detect general patterns and trends
  - detect outliers and unusual patterns
  - graphical elements : points, lines, shapes, colors and size
  - representation, arrangement, selection
  - plot()
    - plot(x, y, type)
    - plot(y~x, data=dataset)
    - LOWESS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing)
      - a method of regression analysis
      - creates a smooth line through a scatterplot
  - ggplot2
    - create complex plots from data 
    - install.packages("ggplot2")
    - library(ggplot2)
    - ggplot()
      - aes() labs() geom_point() geom_histogram()
    - Line chart
      - displays information as a series of data points
      - geom_line() geom_point()
    - Bar chart
      - presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values
      - geom_bar() geom_bar(position="dodge") geom_bar(position="fill")
    - Histogram
      - organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges. 
      - summarize discrete or continuous data that are measured on an interval scale 
      - geom_histogram()
    - Scatter plot
      - shows the relationship between different variables 
      - geom_point()
      - qplot() geom=c("point", "smooth")
    - Box plots 
      - show the distribution of numerical data and skewness 
      - five-number summary 
        - minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum
      - boxplot()
    - Matrix plot
      - an array of scatterplots
      - relationships among pairs of variables
      - pairs()
  - plot3D
    - plot multi-dimensional data
    - library(plot3D)
    - hist3D()
  - Faceting
    - the process that split the chart window in several small parts (a grid)
    - display a similar chart in each section

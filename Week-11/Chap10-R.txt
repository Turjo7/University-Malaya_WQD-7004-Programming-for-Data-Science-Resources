Machine Learning with R

- Machine Learning
  - automates the process of data analysis
  - makes data-informed predictions in real-time without any human intervention
  - use cases
    - email categorization
    - anomaly Detection
    - OCR, image recognition
    - log file analysis 
    - detect trends 
    - predict stock price
  - supervised learning
    - apply what has been learned in the past to new data
      - Regression
        - predicts one set of numbers given another set of numbers.
      - Classification
        - identify which set of categories a new observation belong
        - confusion matrix
          - a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model
          - True positives (TP)
            - predicted yes and they do have the disease.
          - True negatives (TN)
            - predicted no and they don't have the disease.
          - False positives (FP)
	    - predicted yes, but they don't actually have the disease (Type 1 error)
          - False negatives (FN)
            - predicted no, but they actually do have the disease (Type II error)  
        - Formula
          - Accuracy - (TP+TN)/total 
          - Misclassification Rate - (FP+FN)/total
          - True Positive Rate - TP/actual yes (sensitivity)
          - False Positive Rate - FP/actual no 
          - True Negative Rate - TN/actual no (1- False Positive Rate ) (specificity)
          - Precision -	TP/predictedyes
          - Prevalence - actualyes/total

  - unsupervised learning
    - when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled
    - Clustering
      - dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that 
        data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points 
        in the same group than those in other groups.

  - semi-supervised
    - use both labeled and unlabeled data for training

  - reinforcement
    - interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards.

  - caret package (Classification And REgression Training)
    - a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models. 
    - install.packages("caret")
    - data splitting
      - split=0.80  # define an 80%/20% train/test split 
    - pre-processing
    - feature selection
    - model tuning using resampling
      - naive bayes model
      - confusionMatrix()
      - train()
    - variable importance estimation

  - Overfitting
    - when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. 
    - use a resampling technique to estimate model accuracy
    - k-fold cross validation    
  - Underfitting
    - a data model is unable to capture the relationship between the input and output variables accurately, generating a high error rate on both the training set and unseen data.

  - Accuracy
  - Kappa
    - values ≤ 0 as indicating no agreement
  - RMSE
    - measure of how well a regression line fits the data points.
  - R-squared
    - represents the goodness of fit of a regression model. 
  - ROC (receiver operating characteristic)
    - show the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. 
  - AUC (Area under the ROC)
   - the measure of the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes
   - used as a summary of the ROC curve 
   - the higher the AUC, the better the performance of the model 
  - Sensitivity (true positive rate)
    - the recall
  - Specificity (1- false positive Rate) 
    - measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified
